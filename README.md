Collaborative project to investigate vaccine effectiveness

## My comtribution
I compressed both two datasets and get the data which starts from May 1st to November 30th.
And I get both sub-datasets in csv files.
The CDCdata_May_to_Nov.csv file shows the vaccination rate. And the JHUdata_May_to_Nov.csv file shows the death rate.
