I've tried to keep my README pretty professional, but still wanted a place to put some final thoughts on the project and a list of things I might try to change 
or improve in the future, hence the creation of FINALTHOUGHTS. Now, I've made more changes to the finals in the main branch and created too many additional ones
to make this branch a good fit for merging with MAIN (_mea culpa_). I'm not dissatisfied with the work I've produced but there are some things I might want to
remember to change, should I ever revisit this branch with a little more time, patience, and know how: 

1. Sections of my code are somewhat clunky and scrumbled together. They work, but I know in my heart that there is a better, less repetitive way to do some of these things even if my brain hasn't figured out how yet. 
2. The visual created by my graph_over_time.py file is accurate but not particularly clear or compelling. It would be worth playing around with other types of graphs to represent this information or maybe breaking it back down to be county by county instead of a summation of data from all the counties. 
3. The visual created by my graph_over_time_Kent_and_Tuscaloosa.py is a stark comparison and a compelling visual but does lose the nuance represented by the full 
data set. To specifically choose two counties, one with a very high vax rate and one with a very low vax rate and then compare them gets a point across, 
but isn't all that objective. If there is merit in making a graph of this kind of comparison (which, given my lack of statistical knowledge I can't say at this 
stage), it would be worth doing some digging to find counties that didn't just have similar population demographics, but also had as many shared factors that 
might be relevant to COVID transmission and treatment as possible to ensure that the difference observed could be conclusively (or at least very reasonably) 
attributed to the difference in vaccination rates. For example, we would want to look for counties that shared similarities in regards to: 
- population density
- mask mandates
- virtual vs. in person schooling
- job markets that were or were not remote compatible
- economic demographics
- racial demographics
- access to and quality of health care resources
